      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Joseph Mawa, a front-end developer slowly transitioning to
        fullstack developer. I started coding as a hobby after graduating
        college. The first language i was introduced to was python. I also toyed
        briefly with R and C before discovering Javascript. Since then i fell in
        love with web development. At school, i studied Physics and Education. I
        worked as a high school teacher before quitting to learn web development
        full time. I am always working towards making myself a better developer.
        In my spare time, you will either find me watching a movie or listening
        to music.
