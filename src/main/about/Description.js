      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Joseph Mawa, a web developer and technical writer. I started
        coding as a hobby after graduating college.The first language I was
        introduced to was python. I also toyed with R and C before discovering
        Javascript. Since then I fell in love with web development. At school, I
        studied Physics and Education. I worked as a high school teacher before
        quitting to learn web development full time. In my spare time, you will
        most likely find me watching a movie, helping out folks at{" "}
